# üê≥ Docker services
These are the services and applications running in my Homelab. \
This mf is very much a work in progress, I am still working on most stuff here.

## üí¢ Why Docker?
Well it's pretty easy to use. I am tired of permission issues and version mismatches, and really appreciate the unification that Docker creates with logs and statuses.

## üöÄ Deployment
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:wraaath-homelab/docker-services.git
```

2. Edit the `.env`-files accordingly. Do something like:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

3. Deploy the Docker-container from the compose file:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
