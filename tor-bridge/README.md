A [Tor bridge](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/docker/), also known as a bridge relay, is a special type of Tor relay that is not listed in the public Tor directory. This means that ISPs or governments trying to block access to the Tor network can't simply block all bridges. Bridges are particularly useful for Tor users under oppressive regimes, and for people who want an extra layer of security because they're worried somebody will recognize that they are contacting a public Tor relay IP address. Most Pluggable Transports, such as obfs4, rely on the use of "bridge" relays.
