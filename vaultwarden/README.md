[Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) is an unofficial, alternative backend for the password manager Bitwarden. It's written in Rust, providing excellent performance and minimum server requirements. While Vaultwarden is used with the Bitwarden clients, it does not implement the same feature set as the Bitwarden server. However, its setup is much simpler. It's perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be ideal.
